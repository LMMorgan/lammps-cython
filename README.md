# lammps-python

A cython wrapper around lammps. Lammps is a great molecular dynamics
package that currently does not have a convenient way to run. The goal
of this project is to put an opinionated wrapper around LAMMPS (the
good parts) and allow the user to easily extend it's functionality in
python.
