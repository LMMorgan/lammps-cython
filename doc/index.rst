Welcome to LAMMPS Python Wrapper
================================

Welcome to LAMMPS's Python Wrapper documentation. Being a relatively
new (1 week old) project the documentation and api are in flux. To get
started I recommend you :ref:`installation` and then walk through the
:ref:`tutorial`. If you are just looking for the api and how you can
use it see the :ref:`api` documentation. The api heavily borrows from
`HOOMD <https://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/>`_ but hopefully the
communitity settles on a universal api for molecular dynamics.
