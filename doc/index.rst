Welcome to LAMMPS Python Wrapper
================================

Welcome to the LAMMPS's Python Wrapper documentation. Being a
relatively new (1 week old) project the documentation and api are in
flux. To get started I recommend you checkout :doc:`installation` and
then walk through the :doc:`tutorial`. Full reference documentation is
available in the :doc:`api` section. The pythonic api heavily borrows
from `HOOMD <https://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/>`_ but hopefully
the communitity settles on a universal api for molecular dynamics.
